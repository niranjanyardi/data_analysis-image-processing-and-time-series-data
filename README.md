patient. u can use image registration or any other technique of your choice to locate the site of cancer. if u are not familiar with registration, please focus on the machine learning problem below.
i have also attached a multi-variate time series data. this was a three-class classification problem. the goal column has three values 0, 1, and 2.  zero means there was no event in that time interval.  to make it easier treat both 1 and 2 cases as the same (so it would be a two-class classification). the other columns are the variables listed in time. for example rows 2 to 90 represent one time series, etc.
